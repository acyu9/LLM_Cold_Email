# Cold Email Generator

This project is an AI-driven tool designed to help software and AI services companies generate personalized cold emails. 
By combining the Llama3.1 open-source language model, ChromaDB for vector storage, Langchain for prompt management, and Streamlit for the interface, this tool streamlines the process of creating tailored email content.

Inspired by the tutorial ["Gen AI Project Using Llama3.1"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CO4E_9V6li0), this project aims to build upon the basic concepts, enhancing the functionality and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Llama3.1**: Open-source large language model for generating email content.
- **ChromaDB**: Vector store for indexing and retrieving relevant information.
- **Langchain**: Framework for chaining models and data.
